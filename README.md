# Food-Recognition-and-Calorie-Detection
Introduction:
In 2016 more than 1.9 billion adults worldwide were overweight, where over 650 million of these were obese. 
If we consider the statistics of Norway for the year 2017, Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) stated in a report last updated late 2017 that 1 out of 4 men and 1 out of 5 women are obese. This is a huge concern and is also a big risk factor for diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, musculoskeletal disorders and some different type of cancers.

By using advanced networks such as ResNet, food can be recognized for what it is. 
Food classification has been done many times already, but there are still no well known method to figure out the nutrition levels of the food found in the images. One of the big issues regarding finding the nutrition levels in an image is that a image is two dimensional, and thereby difficult to figure out size of the food in the image. It will therefore be important to find a way to measure the amount of food found in the image.

**Problem Statement:**

1. Challenges include accurate detection and classification of food items with variations in appearance, shape, and contextual information.
2. Existing manual methods for food logging are time-consuming, error-prone, and subjective. 
3. The need for a robust and user-friendly solution using machine learning techniques
4. Recognition of diverse food items and estimation of their caloric content.
